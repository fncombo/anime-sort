![dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/fncombo/animesort)

This app uses the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to sort anime by continuously comparing two anime against each other. Each anime gains and loses ranking points based on which anime it won against or lost to.
